* Purpose of this app is to combine some of the features of the Spring Social Showcase with the typical behavior
 you'd also expect when working with a facebook canvas app in an iframe. In a current project we have to integrate
 with we aren't using SpringSecurity, so this application also doesn't use SpringSecurity. It uses a simple SecurityService
 class. (Doesn't rely on the cookie based approach of the basic spring social app or spring social canvas.)


* IMPORTANT* currently this app resuses the facebook application setup for 'springsocialcanvas'
  For this reason this app builds a war called spring-social-canvas.war
  The URL is thus http://apps.facebook.com/springsocialcanvas

* Build and run:
  Build with maven: mvn clean install
  Deploy target/spring-social-canvas.war to Tomcat 6 (or greater) and start tomcat
  Access the project via Facebook at http://apps.facebook.com/springsocialcanvas.
  (For nix users there is a buildAndDeploy script that will build, stop tomcat, clean Tomcat temp dirs,
  clean logs, deploy app, start tomcat -  I know I should use the tomcat plugin - lazy for now:)

* logging set up (with log4j.xml and spring using sl4j) *NOTE* Can someone help me configure it correctly.
  You'll see Tomcat errors if you have two wars set up like this with logging done the same way. I'm sure it's
  related to my spring logging declaration in the web.xml?

* Like the spring social canvas app, this one attempts to sign you in automatically with facebook.
  It differs though, in that it doesn't rely on the cookie stuff and it also does display a signin/singup form
  if your real account hasn't been associated with facebook yet. (Like spring social canvas 'disconnect from facebook'
  isn't provided either since this app is supposed to used within a logged in facebook account.)

* Uses tiles like spring-social-showcase

* Uses a modified UserInterceptor like spring-social-canvas

* Various other changes were made within the application to merge some of the concepts of Spring Social Showcase and the
  spring social canvas app.

* I'm still pretty new to using spring mvc so I could have set things up in ways that I shouldn't - so please let me know
  of any mistakes. All suggestions are welcome.

* I know.. no unit tests yet or anything. TODO
